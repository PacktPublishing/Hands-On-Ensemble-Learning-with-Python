This is the code repository for [Hands-On Ensemble Learning with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/data/hands-on-ensemble-learning-with-python), published by Packt.

**Build highly optimized ensemble machine learning models using scikit-learn and Keras**

## What is this book about?
Ensembling is a technique for combining two or more similar or dissimilar machine learning algorithms to create a model that delivers superior predictive power. This book will demonstrate how you can use a variety of weak algorithms to make a strong predictive model.

With its hands-on approach, you'll not only get up to speed on the basic theory, but also the application of various ensemble learning techniques. Using examples and real-world datasets, you'll be able to produce better machine learning models to solve supervised learning problems such as classification and regression. Later in the book, you'll go on to leverage ensemble learning techniques such as clustering to produce unsupervised machine learning models. As you progress, the chapters will cover different machine learning algorithms that are widely used in the practical world to make predictions and classifications. You'll even get to grips with using Python libraries such as scikit-learn and Keras to implement different ensemble models.

By the end of this book, you will be well versed in ensemble learning and have the skills you need to understand which ensemble method is required for which problem, in order to successfully implement them in real-world scenarios.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Implement ensemble methods to generate models with high accuracy
* Overcome challenges such as bias and variance
* Explore machine learning algorithms to evaluate model performance
* Understand how to construct, evaluate, and apply ensemble models
* Analyze tweets in real time using Twitter's streaming API
* Use Keras to build an ensemble of neural networks for the MovieLens dataset
